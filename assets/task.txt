Create a framework that does tf-idf transformation, you can use sklearn's tfidf function.
Keep the following in mind

* Handle Edge Cases : what happens when new text data arrives
* Create Unit Tests : check failure scenarios
* Add Docstrings : assume you will hand this code to some other SWE
* Obey Engineering Best Practices
* Use necessary inheritances
 
Create a package out of this framework by using docker.
